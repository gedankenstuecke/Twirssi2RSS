Twirssi2RSS takes the twirssi-logfile and creates an RSS-feed which contains the 10 most popular links for the current day. 

If you already ran the script earlier it appends the new items to the feed, so old "links of the day" don't get lost. a simple example of the script in action can be found at http://phylomemetic-tree.de/toplinks.xml

Requirements: 
* A twirssi-logfile, which can be created by using irssi [1] and twirssi [2]
* The PyRSS2Gen [3] module for Python

Feel invited to play around and optimize the results of this little tool. It's published under the Do What The Fuck You Want To Public License [4].

Cheers,
Bastian
